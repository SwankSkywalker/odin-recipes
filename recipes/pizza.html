    <h2>Delicious pie ideal for fun guys!</h2>
        <p>Funghi pizza is pizza topped with a variety of different fungi. Don't worry, they won't take you for any trips though.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough (best if you make it)</li>
            <li>Alfredo sauce is my go-to for funghi pizza</li>
            <li>Cheese...do you consider it pizza if there is no cheese?</li>
            <li>Mushrooms. The ones from behind your house will do</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Making the Pie</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make your dough into a shape. Circles are standard, try a sphere if you're feeling gutsy.</li>
            <li>Evenly spread the sauce over your dough.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add those mushrooms from under the tree in your backyard and TADA!! you've done it!</li>
            <li>Make sure your oven is at 425 degrees and place the pizza in the middle rack for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and serve while hot.</li>
        </ol>
