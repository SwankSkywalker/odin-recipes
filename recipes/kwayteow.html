    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of the most <strong><em>epic</em></strong> noodle dishes in the world from the streets of Malaysia: Char Kway Teow! Big flavours, contrasting textures and the signature hint of charred smokiness, this is bold South East Asian food at its best!</p>
        <p>Char kway teow (炒粿条; chao guo tiao in Mandarin) is a dish of flat rice noodles and tubular yellow wheat noodles fried in garlic, sweet soya sauce and lard, with ingredients such as egg, Chinese waxed sausage, fishcake, beansprouts and cockles.</p>

            <li>2 1/2 cups bean sprouts</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 tsp light soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
                <li>4 tsp kecap manis / sweet soy sauce</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix Sauce Together</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large non stick skillet over high heat.</li>
            <li>When heated, add chicken and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until just cooked through, then remove into bowl</li>
            <li>Add carrots, and cook for 1 minute until carrot is caramelized, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp oil then add egg and cook, pushing in the edges to make a thick omelette. Once set, chop it up roughly using a wooden spoon, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add bean sprouts and cook for about 1 minute until just starting to wilt, then add to bowl.</li>
            <li>Add garlic then immediately add noodles. Fold gently 4 times using a spatula + wooden spoon (see video) just to disperse oil through noodles.</li>
            <li>Tip all the other ingredients back in plus the chives. Fold gently twice, then pour all the Sauce over.</li>
            <li>Gently toss 4 to 6 times to disperse the sauce, pausing in between to allow the noodles to have a chance to caramelize on the edges a bit</li>
            <li>Remove from stove and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
